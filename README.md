# Killing Floor 2 HUD

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/InsultingPros/KF2HUD/total)

KF 2 HUD and assets for Killing Floor 1. All credits to [Zedek](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067265112).

* Edited sources should work as is when extended to scrn, Zedek's will not.
Maybe I have some fuckups somewhere, fix them.

* Colored parts of hud were edited to white in photoshop so other colors don't mix and pollute when changing with code.
Look for (26, 44, 100) RGB values to change color from blue.

* Added true KF2 font instead of the 'Elegance' font that Zedek had originally.

* Sharing this since people already ripped everything they needed.
